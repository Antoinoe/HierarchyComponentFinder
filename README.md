# Hierarchy Component Finder
## Installation
### About 
**Hi, thanks for downloading this package.** 
*Hierarchy Component Finder* is a tool window for the Editor of Unity that allows you to find all game objects in your hierarchy by searching the name of a component. 
### Setup
Once you've imported the package in Unity, you can open the tool window as it is shown in the image *0.png*.
The image *1.png* shows you how the tool works. 
Once you've entered the name of the component you want to find in your scene, click on the "Research" button.
If you find any results, you can click on the button you want to access the game object in your hierarchy. 

The search field is **not** case sensitive. So searching "coll" will find all of the components containing the string "coll" (Sphere Collider, Box Collider 2D, etc.)

This search engine also works for scripts. 

The source code is available in your package folder and on GitHub (link below)
Feel free to modify it for your needs
